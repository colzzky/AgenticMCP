/**
 * Entry Point Tests
 * 
 * This file serves as a documentation entry point for the tests covering src/index.ts
 * and its core components.
 * 
 * It imports no actual code but serves as documentation for the test structure.
 */

/**
 * List of test files:
 * 
 * 1. tests/mainDI.test.ts (NEW APPROACH):
 *    - Tests the fully dependency-injectable main function
 *    - Directly tests the actual implementation with mocked dependencies
 *    - Provides better test coverage and change detection
 *    - Follows best practices for dependency injection
 *    - Covers key architectural components from KNOWLEDGE.md
 *    - Tests Core Framework, Provider System, Tool Calling, and architectural patterns
 * 
 * 2. tests/index.test.ts:
 *    - Tests the main application entry point flow
 *    - Verifies proper initialization sequence and error handling
 *    - Ensures all components are wired together correctly
 * 
 * 3. tests/core/setup/dependencySetup.test.ts:
 *    - Tests the dependency injection container setup
 *    - Verifies correct registration of core services
 *    - Ensures the dependency lifecycle is properly managed
 * 
 * 4. tests/core/setup/programSetup.test.ts:
 *    - Tests the program execution flow for the CLI
 *    - Verifies help documentation display
 *    - Tests error handling for various scenarios
 *    - Ensures proper command line argument processing
