# ES Module Testing - Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the changes made to support robust ES module testing in this codebase.

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Mocking Order**: Ensuring mocks are registered before importing modules
2. **ES Module Compatibility**: Supporting both default and named exports
3. **Type Safety**: Maintaining TypeScript type safety in mocks
4. **Singleton Pattern**: Properly handling singleton instances in tests

## Major Changes Implemented

### 1. DIContainer Fixes

- Fixed singleton lifecycle management
- Enhanced `getSingleton` and `get` methods to properly handle undefined vs. null
- Improved test assertions to match expected behavior

### 2. Enhanced Mock Setup Pattern

- Established consistent pattern using `beforeAll` with async module imports
- Ensured all mocks properly support both default and named exports
- Added proper typing to all mock functions

### 3. Improved Test Utilities

- Enhanced `setupFsPromisesMock` and `setupKeytarMock` to be type-safe
- Fixed mock implementations to handle common scenarios like encoding options
- Added helper utility `setupLoggerMock` for consistent logger mocking
- Created mock modules for tests (e.g., logger-module.ts, service-module.ts)

### 4. Consistent Use of Jest.unstable_mockModule

- Replaced use of custom `mockESModule` with direct use of `jest.unstable_mockModule`
- Ensured proper mock registration with both default and named exports
- Added examples of proper module mocking patterns

### 5. Fixed Test Files

- Updated credential tests to properly mock keytar
- Fixed file system testing in mock examples
- Added missing mock modules for tests

## Best Practices Established

1. Always set up mocks BEFORE importing any modules that use them
2. Use `beforeAll` to register mocks and import modules
3. Use `beforeEach` to reset mock implementations for each test
4. Support both default and named exports in mocks
5. Add proper typing to all mock functions
6. Test both success and error cases
7. Reset modules between tests to ensure clean state
