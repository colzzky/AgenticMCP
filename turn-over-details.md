This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context.
   The conversation is summarized below:
  I'll create a detailed summary of our conversation, focusing on the technical 
  aspects, code patterns, and architectural decisions made. Let me start by analyzing 
  the conversation.

  <analysis>
  The conversation focused primarily on improving the testing approach for the 
  AgenticMCP TypeScript project. 

  1. Initial Analysis:
     - The user asked me to run the tests and report back which tests were failing with
   the most errors.
     - I ran the tests using `npm test` and found multiple failing test files, with 
  several having significant numbers of errors.
     - I organized the test failures by quantity of errors in each file.

  2. Testing Issues Identified:
     - The tests were using hard-coded mocks that weren't adapting to implementation 
  changes.
     - There was a specific issue mentioned about the recent addition of the 
  `allowFileOverwrite` feature, which the mocks didn't reflect.
     - The project was using a mix of ESM and CommonJS module syntax in mocks, causing 
  compatibility issues.
     - There were type mismatches between expected and actual return types.
     - Many mock objects weren't properly initialized before test runs.

  3. Testing Approach Recommendations:
     - I provided a detailed analysis of better testing approaches, including:
       - Using dependency injection instead of hard-coded mocks
       - Using partial mocking with Jest's spyOn
       - Testing against interfaces rather than implementations
       - Emphasizing integration tests over unit tests
       - Using testing libraries designed for this problem
       - Adopting contract testing for service boundaries

  4. Implementation Plan:
     - I provided a concrete implementation plan for improving the testing approach, 
  including:
       - Creating test factories
       - Using in-memory file systems
       - Updating role-based tools tests
       - Implementing adapter pattern for external dependencies

  5. Reference Material:
     - The user shared some context about testing approaches:
       - Jest mocking guide for TypeScript projects
       - A document about the jest-mock-extended library

  6. Key Tests and Files:
     - The most problematic test files identified were:
       - `localCliTool.test.ts` (23+ errors)
       - `mcpServer.test.ts` (8 errors)
       - `toolExecutor.test.ts` (7 errors)
  </analysis>

  <summary>
  1. Primary Request and Intent:
     The user wanted to improve the testing approach in the AgenticMCP TypeScript 
  project. They identified an issue with the current use of hard-coded mocks, stating: 
  "current we are using __mocks__, which are hard-coded replica of the actual logic - 
  the problem is, if we change the actual logic, the replicas will need manual 
  updating, and if we forget to update the replica/mock when we update the real logic, 
  we will get false tests." The user requested advice on better testing approaches.

  2. Key Technical Concepts:
     - **Dependency Injection**: Passing dependencies through constructors or 
  parameters instead of hard-coding them
     - **Jest's spyOn**: For temporarily mocking specific methods on real objects
     - **Interface-Based Testing**: Testing against behavior contracts rather than 
  implementation details
     - **Integration Testing**: Testing multiple components working together with real 
  implementations
     - **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**: For intercepting network requests at the network 
  level
     - **In-Memory Test Helpers**: For file system operations in tests
     - **Contract Testing**: Defining and verifying contracts at service boundaries
     - **Test Factories**: Creating standardized methods for test object creation
     - **Adapter Pattern**: Using adapters for external dependencies to facilitate 
  testing
     - **jest-mock-extended**: A library for type-safe mocking in Jest

  3. Files and Code Sections:
     - **tests/tools/localCliTool.test.ts** (most errors: 23+)
       - This file is critical as it contains tests for the LocalCliTool that handles 
  file operations
       - Major issues with mocks not reflecting the implementation, especially after 
  the `allowFileOverwrite` feature was added
       - Multiple failures in constructor validation, security checks, and file 
  operation mocks

     - **tests/mcp/mcpServer.test.ts** (8 errors)
       - Tests for the MCP server component that handles the Model Context Protocol
       - Issues with mocked loggers not capturing expected calls
       - Problems with tool registration and transport connections

     - **tests/tools/toolExecutor.test.ts** (7 errors)
       - Tests for the component that executes tools based on commands
       - Failures in tool call execution and registration of tool implementations
       - Issues with mock validation for logger calls

     - **src/tools/localCliTool.ts**
       - This file implements file system operations with the recently added 
  `allowFileOverwrite` feature
       - The implementation changed but the mocks didn't adapt, leading to test 
  failures

  4. Problem Solving:
     - Identified the root causes of the test failures:
       1. Hard-coded mocks that don't reflect implementation changes
       2. Module format incompatibility (ESM vs CommonJS)
       3. Type mismatches between expected and actual return types
       4. Missing or improperly set up mocks
       5. Error handling issues in tests

     - Provided specific solutions for better testing:
       1. Use real dependencies where possible, with dependency injection
       2. Use Jest's spyOn for temporary mocking only
       3. Test against interfaces rather than concrete implementations
       4. Create reusable test factories for test objects
       5. Implement in-memory file systems for testing
       6. Use adapters for external dependencies

  5. Pending Tasks:
     - Evaluate and implement the suggested testing improvements
     - Fix the failing tests, starting with the most critical ones (localCliTool, 
  mcpServer, toolExecutor)
     - Consider adopting jest-mock-extended for type-safe mocking

  6. Current Work:
     The conversation was focused on analyzing test failures and recommending better 
  testing approaches. I had just completed running the tests and providing a detailed 
  breakdown of the errors, organized by file and quantity. I also provided an extensive
   recommendation on improving the testing approach using dependency injection, 
  interface-based testing, and other modern practices.

     The most recent information shared was about jest-mock-extended, a library that 
  provides type-safe mocking for Jest, which could potentially help address the issues 
  with the current hard-coded mocks.

  7. Optional Next Step:
     The next step would be to begin implementing some of the suggested testing 
  improvements, starting with the most critical files like localCliTool.test.ts. This 
  would involve:
     
     1. Creating a test-specific implementation of the file system operations
     2. Modifying the LocalCliTool to accept file system implementations via dependency
   injection
     3. Updating the tests to use these implementations rather than hard-coded mocks
     
     However, I would first confirm with the user whether they want to proceed with 
  these specific improvements before making any changes to the codebase.

  any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
