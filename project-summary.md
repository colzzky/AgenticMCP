# AgenticMCP CLI Project Summary

## Main Goal

AgenticMCP (Agentic Model Communication Protocol) is a TypeScript-based command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to make it easy for users to interact with various Large Language Models (LLMs) as predefined agents. The main goal is to provide a user-friendly, installable CLI that allows users to leverage multiple LLM providers (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) through specialized command agents, each with specific roles, system prompts, and model configurations. The system is intended to simplify complex LLM interactions, requiring users to only provide relevant context for their tasks.

## Key Features

- **Predefined Agent Commands**: A library of specialized commands (writer, coder, analyst, summarizer, etc.) with optimized prompts and roles.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Integration with major LLM providers via adapters, with unified configuration and fallback mechanisms.
- **Context Management**: Flexible context input (files, directories, stdin), context window optimization, caching, and preprocessing.
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Uses `keytar` for secure API key management in the system keychain.
- **Output Formatting**: Supports multiple output formats (text, markdown, JSON), streaming, and progress indicators.
- **Configuration Management**: Handles configuration files, environment variables, and supports user overrides and validation.
- **Session and History Management**: Tracks command history, supports session persistence, and enables command chaining.
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for new commands and providers, with developer-friendly documentation and standards.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, installable via npm with minimal dependencies.

## Current Status (from TASKS.jsonl)

- The project is in its early stages, with the initial project repository and structure being set up.
- Architecture guidelines, TypeScript project scaffolding, and development environment configuration are pending.
- Most core features (CLI framework, configuration, provider adapters, context management, command registry, etc.) are listed as pending tasks.
- The first task ("Initialize Project Repository") is in progress, assigned to the project manager.
- All other tasks (architecture, coding, testing, documentation, release preparation, etc.) are pending and assigned to various roles (architect, coder, tester, project manager, chief product officer).
- The project is following a phased implementation plan, starting with the core CLI framework and expanding to advanced features and ecosystem support.
