### üîÑ Prompt: High-Fidelity Turnover Summary for LLM Continuity

I want to offload your working memory and save it to `./turn-over-details.md` so the next LLM agent can seamlessly continue where you left off. This summary must provide **a complete representation of the historical conversation context**, including key decisions, technical paths, and active problem-solving progress.

Please generate a **structured, concise, and self-contained turnover summary** based on our entire conversation history. This will serve as a high-fidelity handoff to preserve decisions, rationale, and current state across sessions.

### üìå Deliverables

#### ‚úÖ Part 1: Action Evaluation

* **What Worked:**
  List the key actions, code implementations, design decisions, or strategies that were successful or led to meaningful progress.

* **What Didn‚Äôt Work:**
  Identify actions, assumptions, or approaches that were ineffective, caused errors, or were later revised‚Äîinclude debugging dead-ends, misaligned assumptions, or false starts.

#### üß† Part 2: Advice to the Next Agent

Provide guidance that a future LLM agent should know to continue effectively:

* Critical watch-outs or known pitfalls
* Architectural or business assumptions that underpin the current approach
* Any known constraints (tech stack, APIs, team workflow, external dependencies)
* Helpful tips, shortcuts, or reusable decisions from this session

#### üìù Part 3: Structured Historical Conversation Summary

A comprehensive, well-organized summary of the full exchange. Must include:

1. **Main Topics Covered**
   Briefly list the high-level themes or problems discussed (e.g., TypeScript DI best practices, Jest mocks, CLI tool architecture, etc.)

2. **Critical Technical Details**
   Include:

   * Code snippets or patterns implemented
   * Key file paths, dependencies, configurations, commands
   * Libraries, frameworks, architecture patterns
   * Error messages encountered and resolutions (if applicable)

3. **Chronological Flow of the Conversation**
   Present how the discussion progressed:

   * Initial questions
   * Iterations and decision points
   * Shifts in direction
   * Resolutions or breakthroughs

4. **Summarized Explanations of Complex Topics**
   Simplify deep technical or architectural reasoning into clear, digestible insights (especially around decisions, patterns, or trade-offs).

5. **Pending Items & TODOs**
   Highlight any:

   * Unresolved questions
   * Follow-up actions needed
   * Implementation tasks still in-progress or blocked

6. **Format Instructions**

   * Use **clear headings**, bullet points, and subheadings for each part
   * Use code blocks for code or config references
   * Make the entire output readable without referring to the original chat
