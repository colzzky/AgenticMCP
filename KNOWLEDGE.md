# AgenticMCP Architecture Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the AgenticMCP codebase architecture and how it aligns with the requirements specified in the README.md.

## Architecture Overview

The project implements a well-structured TypeScript CLI tool for interacting with various LLM providers through a unified interface. The architecture follows clean separation of concerns with these key components:

### 1. Core Framework

- **Configuration Management** (`src/core/config/`)
  - JSON-based configuration with platform-specific storage locations
  - Fallback mechanism to default configurations
  - Support for provider-specific configurations

- **Credential Management** (`src/core/credentials/`)
  - Uses keytar for secure storage in system keychains
  - Stores credentials with provider-specific prefixes
  - Provides methods to get, set, and delete secrets

- **Type System** (`src/core/types/`)
  - Strong typing for commands, providers, and tools
  - Interfaces for standardizing interactions
  - Common types for request/response formats

- **Logging** (`src/core/utils/logger.ts`)
  - Provides standard log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
  - Environment variable control for debug output
  - Centralized logging for consistent output

### 2. Provider System

- **Provider Factory** (`src/providers/providerFactory.ts`)
  - Abstract factory pattern for LLM provider instantiation
  - Dynamic provider registration and caching
  - Provider type discovery and validation

- **Provider Initializer** (`src/providers/providerInitializer.ts`)
  - Central registration for all provider types
  - Convenience methods for provider configuration

- **Provider Implementations**
  - Adapter pattern for different LLM services
  - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Grok providers
  - Standardized request/response formats across providers

### 3. Command System

- **Command Registry** (`src/core/commands/registry.ts`)
  - Registry pattern with decorator-based registration
  - Command categorization and aliasing
  - Command execution with error handling

- **Command Decorators** (`src/core/commands/decorators.ts`)
  - `@AgentCommand` - Defines a command class
  - `@CommandHandler` - Defines subcommands
  - `@CommandParam` - Parameter definitions and annotations

- **Command Initializer** (`src/core/commands/initializer.ts`)
  - Dynamically loads command modules
  - Initializes the command registry

### 4. Context Management

- **Context Manager** (`src/context/contextManager.ts`)
  - File-based context loading and processing
  - Directory traversal with pattern matching
  - Token counting for context optimization

- **Context Types** (`src/core/types/context.types.ts`)
  - `ContextItem` - Single piece of context with metadata
  - `ContextSource` - Sources from which context can be loaded
  - `ContextProcessor` - Interface for context transformations

### 5. Tool Calling System

- **Tool Registry** (`src/tools/toolRegistry.ts`)
  - Central registry for tool/function definitions
  - Provider-specific tool validation
  - Registration of local CLI tools

- **Tool Executor** (`src/tools/toolExecutor.ts`)
  - Executes tool calls from LLMs
  - Handles timeouts and retries
  - Formats execution results

- **Tool Execution Manager** (`src/tools/toolExecutionManager.ts`)
  - Manages the execution flow between LLM and tools
  - Processes tool calls and formats results
  - Updates conversation context with tool results

- **Dynamic Tool Calling Workflow**
  - Tools are made available to the LLM but not predetermined for use
  - The LLM agent autonomously decides which tools to call based on context
  - When tool calls are detected in LLM output, they're automatically executed
  - Tool execution results are fed back to the LLM for further analysis
  - The LLM produces a final response incorporating tool results
  - This creates a recursive pattern: LLM → tool calls → tool execution → results back to LLM → final output

### 6. Conversation Management

- **Conversation Manager** (`src/conversation/conversationManager.ts`)
  - Multi-turn conversation with state tracking
  - Integration of tool calls and results
  - Session management for continued conversations
